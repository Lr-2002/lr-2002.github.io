Hi there, this is Lr-2002(Xianhao Wang) from China. 
I'm now a first year student in my Ph.D. in USTC, interning at BIGAI which is especially near to PKU, so meet with me if you are here.  I was graduated from Xidian University from Xi'an, major was Robotics. My life scope is to build business driven robotics system (which could improve human's life), so if you have some startup idea, contact me please.

My mainly research focus is about Robotics Manipulation, VLA and World Model.
- **Robotics Manipulation**: Tabletop Manipulation, including parallel Gripper and Dexterous Hand
- **VLA**: Vision Language Action Model, from E2E VLA and CodeAsPolicy-style method. 
- **World Model**: Especially Vision World Model.
